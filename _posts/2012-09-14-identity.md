<br/><br/>Since I left the cubicle life, i have been meeting a lot of brilliant and smart people online and offline. hearing about their ideas and plans to take over the world with their products and things they are building and planning to build. one of the best things it taught me was never to judge any one by how they look or by what they say or by what they wear or any other criteria. I know it's very easy to say that but very difficult to practice. When you start practicing something for a long duration it becomes a habit. 
<br/><br/>It helps to get the best things from every person without any preconceived notions about them and thus helps a lot when you talk to them since what we think about a person dictates how we behave around them.
<br/><br/>How do you behave around people with whom you are not comfortable with?
