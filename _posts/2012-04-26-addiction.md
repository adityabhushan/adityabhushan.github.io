<p>Few Reasons why I hate it.</p> <p>1) It is Limited.</p> <p>2) I can't Decide it on my own (No, I am not asking for a billion dollar cheque or May be I am ).</p> <p>3) I have to wait for Thirty Days to Get it.</p> <p>4) I have to care about the right side of the menu before ordering my meal.</p> <p>5) I have to do work which i am not passionate about.</p> <p>6) I have to lie about it to people, when they ask. and hence commit a sin.</p> <p>7) My choices are limited to my Cash Inflow.</p> <p>8) I have to wait for Years before it gets doubled.</p> <p>9) My wishlist is still waiting to be ticked of and may have to wait forever.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>


</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How do I get Rid of it ??</strong></h2> <p>1) Decide what i love to do.</p> <p>2) This way i wont have to wait for a paycheck to fulfill my passions.</p> <p>3) I can work as per my wishes and i would be doing what i want to do not what others want me to do.</p> <p>4) Start a business out of it, people have made money selling stones, this will be much easier.</p> <p>5) You will get to meet great people, and you will enjoy learning and being with them.</p> <p>6) You will know who is you friend and who is not.</p> <p>8) Don't get into <a class="zem_slink" title="Analysis paralysis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">analysis paralysis</a>, just do it, you wont regret it.</p> <p>9) If you value freedom, then believe me, this is the best thing which will ever happen to you.</p>
