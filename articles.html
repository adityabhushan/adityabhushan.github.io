<p>I worked at NeXT the summer of 94. I was in the break room with two colleagues when Jobs walked in and started making a bagel.</p><p>We were sitting at a table eating ours when he out of the blue asked us “Who is the most powerful person in the world?”</p><p>I said Mandela since I had just been there as an international  observer for the elections. In his confident fashion he stated “NO!…you  are all wrong… <b>the most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.”</b></p><p> At this point I was thinking to myself “Steve, I love you but  there is a fine line between genius and loco..and I think I am  witnessing this right now”.</p><p>Steve continued, <b>“The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come and Disney has a monopoly on the storyteller business. You know what? I am  tired of that bullshit, I am going to be the next storyteller”</b> and he walked out with his bagel.</p>
