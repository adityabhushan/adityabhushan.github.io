    <h1>Minimalism</h1>
  	
    <p class="muted">03 June 2013</p>

    <p>How being minimal can help you (and the world) as well.
few months back in one of the events i attended, i met a lady from Singapore who came with the luggage of the world (her suitcase was so big that i could have easily fit in) she wanted a place to keep her suitcase safely. Being the gentleman i am, it is understood that i helped the lady find a place for her suitcase and helped her with it(it was extremely heavy). but i always wondered what was in the suitcase that she had to <b>carry the worries of the entire kashmir in it</b>. That was my eureka moment for a new project on minimalism.</p>

<p><b>Minimalism is a low consumption way of living</b>. the reason i follow minimalism and try to be minimal is to decrease my dependence on things and also help reduce consumption.</p>

<p>It has long been observed that the less things we are dependent upon, the less we have to worry about, in turn the happier we are.</p>

<p>currently i have given up using a watch(It was a very difficult decision) from past three months. My ultimate goal is to strip down to less than 10 items (including the Number of clothes).</p>

<p>The project is meant to go on for 100 days but will be happy to carry it forward as go on for as long as i like.
currently my frequently  used stuff consists of</p>

<div class='highlight'><br/>1) 5 pairs of cloths (one for each day of the week)<br/>
<br/>2) 2 pair of socks<br/>
<br/>3) 1 pair of shoes<br/>
<br/>4) 1 laptop<br/>
<br/>5) 1 Digital camera<br/>
<br/>6) 1 Notebook<br/>
<br/>7) 1 Pen<br/>
<br/>8) 1 Bag to carry everything (I do not use plastic covers)<br/>
<br/>9) 1 Motorcycle (I walk to work/use public transport on weekends)<br/>
<br/>10) A dongle for Internet (<strike>Borrowed</strike>, Bought) <br/>
<br/>11) Cell Phone <strike>with 2G Internet connection (I use GPS to measure distances while walking)</strike><br/>
<br/>12) A pair of Ray Ban Aviator sunglasses<br/>
<br/><strike>13) 3 Pairs of Cuff Links (used rarely)<br/>
<br/>14) 2 Pairs of Ascots (used rarely)</strike><br/>

Here is <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff/">something for you, which will show you how when something is created a lot of waste is added to the environment along with some intangible byproducts.</a></p>
