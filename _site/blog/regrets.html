    <h1>What do you regret not doing in your 20&#039;s?</h1>
  	
    <p class="muted">31 August 2012</p>

    <p>Those Who are in their 20's can Learn from This.</p>

<p>It's not regret. But looking back, it seems my life would have been better if I had done / had known these earlier:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>On love:</strong> Leave an unhappy relationship. It's not about commitment. It's about how to respect yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>On work:</strong> Quit an unhappy job. The feeling of being caged, deprived of the opportunity to learn new things simply because of your role - are not compensated by pay or even gratification of supporting your loved ones.</li>
    <li><strong>On emotion:</strong> Appreciate, listen to, even indulge in emotions sometimes. It keeps a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">human</span> life. No worries, we're rational enough. Our brain is amazing.</li>
    <li><strong>On body:</strong> Have happy (safe) sex more and earlier. Play fun sports more and earlier. Feeling a cramp in my leg once saved me from depression due to overthinking.</li>
    <li><strong>On money:</strong> More is not better. There's a threshold over which you feel secured and free to pursue your dreams. Work constantly to lower this threshold. It frees you from constraints that you set for yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>On desire/passion:</strong> It's OK that desire/passion changes over time. Someday the dots can be linked. Before that, follow the passion even as it takes leaps and seems without focus.</li>
    <li><strong>On fear:</strong> Never act/decide out of fear. You're doomed. Lying is an example.</li>
    <li><strong>On people:</strong> Stay around those you want to become. If your network is not given, create it yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>On human life:</strong> You can change your life. Be kind, be honest (to others and to yourself), be grateful. Genuine happiness triumphs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Regret is a self-referencing concept in the sense that you only become the person with regret <em>because</em> you were once the person you now feel regret on.</p>

<p>Maybe some journey must be traveled in order to learn from it. Maybe we should be grateful that, finally, we realize what we regret. Then everything is worth it.</p>

<p>Things I'm glad that I did early on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>On family:</strong> Invest in it heavily. They may disappoint you. But they're (usually) there to cheer you up when the world disappoints you. (maybe I'm the lucky one)</li>
    <li><strong>On knowledge:</strong> Read a lot. Study logic and philosophy. Master a second language that represents a different culture. It changes the way you think.</li>
</ul>
